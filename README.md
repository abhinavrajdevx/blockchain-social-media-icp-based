There are limited cycles so be careful do not overload :)


ABOUT

A Social Media deployed on ICP ( Internet Computer Protocol ) blockchain. 
Uses ICP for hosting ( Juno ), DataStore and Storage.


Operations :

1. Create Post with a Image and a caption
2. Log in with Internet identity ( by ICP )
3. Edit account including name and profile photo.
4. Add comment to a post.
5. Storing the auth info on restart.


Existing bugs ( !! THIS PROJECT WAS AMDE IN A HACKATHON CONDUCTED BY ICP !! ) :

1. After changing name it does not reflects in previous posts and comments.
2. Same issue as 1 with profile photos
3. poor implementation of comments and thus not scalable.

I will be fixing the issues and make the code be of production level as soon as I get time.
